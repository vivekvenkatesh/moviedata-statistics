MapReduce program to analyze a Movie Dataset
============================================

There are 3 datafiles :: movies.dat, ratings.dat, users.dat.

Write an efficient map reduce program to do the following:

Q1. Find all the user ids who has rated at least n movies. (n=30 or 40) [use only ratings.dat as input file]

Q2. Given some movie titles - find all the genres of the movies. (Taking the movie titles as command line input is a must here) [use only movies.dat as input file]

Q3. Find the top 10 zipcodes based on the avarage age of users belong to that zipcode, in the descending order of the avarage age. Top 10 means the youngest 10 avarage age of users of that zipcode. (Use of Chaining of two map-reduce job is a must here.) [use only users.dat as input file]
